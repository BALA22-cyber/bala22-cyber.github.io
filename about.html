            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I am a dedicated Robotics Engineer with a Master of Science in Robotics from the University of Maryland, College Park. With a Bachelor's in Mechatronics from Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, I possess a deep understanding of both mechanical systems and advanced robotics.</p>

            <p>My journey in robotics is marked by a strong blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application, enhanced by advanced coursework in Robot Programming, Robot Perception, Deep Learning and AI, Autonomous Robotics, and Human-Robot Interaction. I am skilled in programming languages such as C++, Python, and MATLAB, and have extensive experience with robotics platforms including ROS, ROS2, and various simulation tools.</p>

            <p>I have applied my knowledge in real-world settings with significant impact. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, I'm actively contributing to the Real-Time Evaluator (RTE) project, enhancing precision in building component placement during crane installation. Previously, at Achara Technologies, I built a machine learning architecture for inspecting fabric defects, significantly improving inspection speed and accuracy.</p>

            <p>I am passionate about leveraging my skills to contribute to cutting-edge projects in robotics and automation, and I am eager to bring my strong technical background and innovative approach to new challenges in the field.</p>
